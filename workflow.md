**This workflow will help you automate two things:**

i) creation of multiple certificates for participants/winners of an event from one or more template certificates <br>
ii) sending of emails using a template email by changing participant-appropriate text and adding attachments (like the certificates generated) if necessary

This can be useful for many events. For example, if you conduct a workshop and want to send out participation certificates, or conduct a quiz, and wants to send out participation certificates along with the different winner certificates. This can be done without having to manually make the changes on a template or sending them individually (or bcc'ing) them.

**Steps**

Skip to step       if you only want to send emails to multiple people

Step 1) Create a/multiple template certificate(s) using any image/slide editing software of your choice. Canva is easiest choice as they have some pre-made certificate templates that are free to you, which you can modify. 

Step 2) Download the temeplate and save it to a folder titled your event name (or simply save it to that folder if you're using an offline editing application).

Step 3) Use this R script (follow the instructions there and edit it according to your requirements): 

This will produce both the individual certificates for each participant as well as certificate_sharing_helper.csv which will be used for sharing emails to individuals with their respective certificates.
