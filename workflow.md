This workflow will help you automate two things:

i) creation of multiple certificates for participants/winners of an event from one or more template certificates <br>
ii) sending of emails using a template email by changing participant-appropriate text and adding attachments (like the certificates generated) if necessary

This can be useful for many events. For example, if you conduct a workshop and want to send out participation certificates, or conduct a quiz, and wants to send out participation certificates along with the different winner certificates. This can be done without having to manually make the changes on a template or sending the individually (or bcc'ing) them.
