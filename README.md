## Introduction


This workflow will help you automate two things:

i) creation of multiple certificates for participants/winners of an event from one or more template certificates <br>
ii) sending of emails using a template email by changing participant-appropriate text and adding attachments (like the certificates generated) if necessary

This can be useful for many events. For example, if you conduct a workshop and want to send out participation certificates, or conduct a quiz, and wants to send out participation certificates along with the different winner certificates. This can be done without having to manually make the changes on a template or sending them individually (or bcc'ing) them.

This will also be useful for sending text emails without any attachments individually to people. For example, to commmunicate that a group of people have been selected for the interview stage for an open position or (equally important) that they haven't been selected.
